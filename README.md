# video_summarizer
I'm trying to make this because everything I found on github really sucks...
I made this because I want to generate video summaries based on chapters if any. Otherwise the summary should be generated into chapters by GPT. Everything needs to be nicely formatted in markdown.

## To-Do
- [x] Get the most basic summary working 
- [ ] Get the video chapters
- [ ] Get the video summary based on chapters
- [ ] Stream response
- [ ] Simple webapp
- [ ] Somehow format the response in proper markdown, right now it doesn't contain the line breaks. All text crambled together.
